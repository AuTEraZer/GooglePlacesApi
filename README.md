# GooglePlacesApi

Since Google's own Places API can be a bit complicated and crowded, this library tries to reflect an intuitive and simple connection to the Google REST API. 
Therefore, with this library it is possible to create both a simple request with little or no parameters or a request with any smallness specification.

Nevertheless, it is important to understand how to build queries to get the necessary data back. Which parameters a request can use or which return the desired value is explained in the section Introduction to the Google Places API.
